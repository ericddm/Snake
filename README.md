Snake-in-LabVIEW
================

This is a simple version of the popular Snake game written purely in LabVIEW. 

To play, simple run the built .exe.  By default, it runs when executed. You use the arrow keys to move your snake, and try to eat all the food (green dots).  While you eat, your tail will grow.  Be sure NOT to eat your own tail or you will lose!!!  If you encounter the edge of the game map, you will wrap around to the other size (pac-man style.)  So you can use this to your advantage!
