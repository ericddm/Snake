Snake-in-LabVIEW
================

This is a simple version of the popular Snake game written purely in LabVIEW. 

To play, simply run the .exe in the Builds folder.  By default, the game starts when executed. You use the arrow keys to move your snake, and try to eat all the food (green dots).  While you eat, your tail will grow.  Be sure NOT to eat your own tail or you will lose!!!  If you encounter the edge of the game map, you will wrap around to the other size (pac-man style.)  So you can use this to your advantage!

To edit the file, simply open the LabVIEW project (Snake.lvproj) and begin editing!  Whenever you are ready, you can use the Build Specifications to run the Application Builder to generate a new .exe.
